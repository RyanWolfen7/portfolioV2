## About

This app is made with a redux thunk pattern. It is still a work in progress so its not to functional right now. In the futer I will mock the data and inject it into the store. I will then make an api and have it stored on the backend. I have alot of future plans for this, but I currently only have a few minutes here and there to commit to the project.

## Todos
- Refactor and Abstact some of my components
- Mock the data to be put into the redux store
- Create an API
- Link the API to the frontend
- Change the Service Worker and transition app into PWA
- Add more features and Jass
